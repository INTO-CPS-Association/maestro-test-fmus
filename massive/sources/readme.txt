This directory contains ALL source files needed in order to 
include a model generated by Dymola into a foreign
simulation environment. The sources have to be selected
in the following way:

ALWAYS to be used:
   amat.c      General utility routines to read/write matrices from/to files.
   dymc.c      C utility routines. Includes the following files:
                   matutil.c
                   delay.c
                   dymtable.c
                   dymf2c.c
   dymf.c      Numerical routines which are provided originally in Fortran
               (directory Dymola/source/fortran) and which have been 
               transformed to C by f2c.
   usertab.c   User adaptable function to store tables in a C-function.
               This file is used as default implementation.
               The tables are stored in "usertab.h" which is included
               into "usertab.c".

ONE of the following files has to be used:
   dsdymo.c    General DSblock interface
   sb2dym.c    Interface to SystemBuild 
   ss2dym.c    Interface to SimStruct (SIMULINK S-Function)


SPECIAL files
   userfunc.c  Included from the model file "dsmodel.c" generated by
               Dymola. By modifying this file, the user can most easily
               incorporate additional code used in the model.
   userdefs.h  Contains definitions that control code generation, for
               example, to disable time events in Simulink model.
   

The following essential flags are used in the codes via #ifdef..:

DYMOSIM        : The model is used within the simulator Dymosim.
MATLAB_MEX_FILE: The model is used within the simulator SIMULINK.
NO_FILE        : A file system is not available on the target
                 machine, e.g. due to realtime simulation.
                 if NO_FILE=1, the file-dependent code is removed
                 from the sources.
DYMOLA_DSPACE  : The model is used for realtime simulation in the
                 dSPACE environment. This option sets NO_FILE as needed.
